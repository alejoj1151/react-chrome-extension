    <strong>
        <h2>Why isn't this extension working?</h2>
    </strong>
    <p>Your web app language must be in <i>English</i>. Other languages are currently not supported. If you're
        interested in helping me add support for another language, please contact me! If your web app language is
        English and it's still not working, please try force quitting Chrome and restarting.</p>

    <strong>
        <h2>Will this extension get me banned?</h2>
    </strong>
    <p>This extension was built with EA's ToS in mind. This extension only exposes keyboard shortcuts for things you
        can already accomplish in the web app, and does not modify the web app in any way. It's not a bot. It's not an
        auto-anything. If you use it responsibly, you shouldn't have any issues. That being said, *use at your own
        risk*. If you email me saying your account was banned or you were coin wiped, I will not respond.</p>

    <strong>
        <h2>Do I have to use Ctrl, Shift, or Alt with my hotkeys?</h2>
    </strong>
    <p>No you don't! Just open the extension popup and click the toggle. This will enabled "Legacy" mode where all the
        shortcuts are just 1 key. The only downside to using this mode is that keyboard shortcuts are not customizable.
        If you wish to have custom shortcuts, you have to use the native Chrome shortcut mode which forces you to use a
        modifier key.</p>

    <strong>
        <h2>Will you add a shortcut for this?</h2>
    </strong>
    <p>Maybe. This extension is a side project for me that yields very little money (only donations from users). If I
        like your idea, I might add it. If I don't, I probably won't. That being said, any request with at least a $10
        donation will be attempted.</p>

    <strong>
        <h2>Still have a question?</h2>
    </strong>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me over email (using extension popup) and I'll usually respond within 24 hours. Please
        remember that there's a team of exactly 1 person working on this project, so response time may vary.</p>
